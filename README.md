## 🎧 Spotify & YouTube Data Analysis Project! 📊🎶

Hello! 🎉 I’m excited to share my Python-based Spotify and YouTube data analysis project, where I explored the world of music and videos, uncovering some cool and fun insights! 🐍💻

Spotify_Youtube_EDA DataSet Information:
The dataset consists of songs from various artists worldwide, and for each song, it includes: various statistics from the music release on Spotify, including the number of streams; and the view count of the official music video on YouTube."

Spotify Columns: Track: Name of the song or track. Artist: Name of the artist or band who performed the track. Duration_ms: Length of the track in milliseconds. Danceability: Measure of how suitable a track is for dancing, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Energy: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the intensity and activity of the track. Key: The musical key in which the track is composed (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, and so on). Loudness: Average loudness of the track in decibels (dB). Speechiness: Amount of spoken words in a track, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Acousticness: Confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. A higher value means the track is more instrumental. Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher values indicate more "live" performance. Valence: Describes the musical positiveness of a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful), and tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, angry). tempo: The overall speed or pace of the track in beats per minute (BPM).

YouTube Columns: Title: Title of the YouTube video. Channel_name: Name of the channel that uploaded the video. Category: Video category assigned by YouTube (e.g., Music, Entertainment, Education). Views: The total number of views the video has received. Likes: The total number of likes on the video. Comments: The total number of comments on video Description: Text description provided by the uploader to describe the video.

Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Spotify and YouTube with Python

Introduction: In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Spotify and YouTube datasets using Python. The goal was to extract insights into music streaming behavior and video content trends, comparing user preferences, engagement metrics, and platform dynamics.

Dataset Description: The Spotify dataset contains information such as track names, artists, popularity, and audio features (e.g., danceability, energy). The YouTube dataset includes video titles, channel information, view counts, likes, dislikes, and engagement metrics. Both datasets allow us to analyze content characteristics and how they influence user interaction.

Tools and Libraries Used: Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

Key Analysis and Insights: Spotify Music Trends: Popular genres and artists over time Audio features like energy and danceability correlated with track popularity Distribution of track lengths and their popularity impact

YouTube Content Insights: Top video categories and creators with highest engagement Correlation between video views, likes, and dislikes Analysis of video upload frequency and its impact on channel growth.

Cross-Platform Comparisons: Comparing content engagement patterns between audio (Spotify) and video (YouTube) Examining how content consumption behaviors differ between music listeners and video viewers

📌 Project Details:

I analyzed Spotify’s top 10 songs and artists 📈🎤 – check out the list of the most popular tracks! 🎶 Looked at the average song duration and found that shorter, more energetic tracks dominate the charts! ⏱⚡ On YouTube, I explored channel-based metrics, likes, comments, and views to identify the most engaging content 🎥👍. Which channels are getting the most views? 👀 Analyzed the distribution of album types; single albums are leading the pack! 📀📊 Explored Spotify metric correlations: Is there a link between song length and popularity? 🎶📊 Compared artists across YouTube and Spotify: Who’s topping the charts on each platform? 🤔📊 Studied the correlations between likes, views, and comments on YouTube; some videos get tons of views but little interaction! 📹❤️💬

💡 Key Findings:

Metallica has the most energetic tracks! 🎸⚡ The Cure is the leader in emotional positivity! 😢🌈 Saweetie produces the most danceable hits! 💃🎶 Comparing Spotify and YouTube streams, certain tracks are chart-toppers on both platforms! 🎶📹 In channel-based analyses, some creators perform differently across the two platforms. 📈📺 All findings and code are now available on GitHub. Check it out for more insights! 🚀👩‍💻

Conclusion: This EDA provided a detailed comparison of user engagement across two leading digital platforms. It highlights key factors that contribute to content success, offering valuable insights for content creators and digital marketers.
